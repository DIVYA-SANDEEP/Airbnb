# Airbnb

Description:
The project begins by establishing a connection to MongoDB Atlas, facilitating data retrieval from the Airbnb dataset and executing queries for analysis. Subsequently, rigorous data cleaning procedures are implemented, addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type transformations to ensure data integrity and prepare the dataset for exploratory analysis. Finally, a Streamlit web application is developed, leveraging Airbnb's geospatial data to create interactive maps that enable users to explore listing distribution, prices, and ratings across diverse locations with ease and flexibility.
